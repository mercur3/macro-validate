* macro-validate

A =Java= library that performs bean validation similar to =javax.validation=, but rather than
validating at runtime, the annotations used here are evaluated at compile time.

** Thread safety

A =Validator= implementation is thread safe if the target annotated with =@Valid= is thread safe
i.e. it is an immutable object.
